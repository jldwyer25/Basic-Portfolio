        <p> Hello, I'm not a wizard, but if you watch me for long enough, you might think that what I do is magic.</p>
        <p> My name is Jimmy Dwyer, and I'm originally from Virginia. I moved to Chicago to try and find out, "Hey, am I funny?" </p>
        <p> I quickly found out I was, and I did a ton of open mics to more than my own success. I went ahead afterwards
            and started doing classes at Improv Olympic and Second City.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> After completing programs at both schools of comedy thought, my bills started to pile up. My hourly pay as a barista at Starbucks
            didn't pay the bills quite the way that was expected and I decided it was time to use
            my degree. I got a job as a book publicist in Chicago, getting clients in magazines, radio, and even TV shows! But, still, the 
            desire to learn and grow continued (this time with enough money) and I sought new pursuits.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> So, now I'm enrolled in the NU Coding Bootcamp, and I couldn't be happier. Please read this.</p>
